## Welcome to MemoryLake

This guide will walk you through the essential features of MemoryLake. By the end, you'll have created a project, uploaded documents, added a memory, and generated an MCP server API key for external access.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Access to a MemoryLake account
- At least one document or folder ready to upload
- Basic familiarity with file management concepts

<Tip>
Have some sample documents ready? PDFs, Markdown files, spreadsheets, and text files all work great with MemoryLake.
</Tip>

## Getting Started

<Steps>

<Step title="Access Your Document Drive">
Navigate to the Document Management section in MemoryLake. You'll see your personal drive with a `My Space` folder ready to store your files.

{/* SCREENSHOT: Initial drive interface showing empty root folder */}

<Check>
You should see a tree view on the left side showing your drive structure and an empty main area ready for content.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Upload Your First Documents">
Click the "Upload" button to add files to your drive.

You can:
- Select individual files
- Select multiple files at once
- Upload entire folders with their structure preserved

{/* SCREENSHOT: Upload dialog with file selection options */}

<Note>
MemoryLake supports .md, .txt, .csv, .pdf, .xlsx, and .xls file formats. Large files are automatically handled with multi-part uploads.
</Note>

Watch the upload progress panel to see your files being processed. Once complete, they'll appear in your file tree.

{/* SCREENSHOT: Upload progress showing multiple files */}

<Check>
Your uploaded files should now be visible in the tree view. Try expanding folders to see their contents.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Organize with Folders">
Create folders to organize your documents:

1. Click the "New Folder" button or right-click in the tree
2. Enter a descriptive folder name
3. Use drag-and-drop to move files into folders

{/* SCREENSHOT: Folder creation dialog and drag-drop operation */}

<Tip>
Use meaningful folder names that reflect your organization structure. You can create nested folders for complex hierarchies.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Create Your First Project">
Navigate to the Project Management section and create a new project:

1. Click "Create Project"
2. Enter a project name (e.g., "Q1 Research")
3. Add a description explaining the project's purpose
4. Click "Save"

{/* SCREENSHOT: Create project dialog with sample data */}

Projects help you organize related documents and provide context for AI interactions.

<Check>
You should see your new project in the projects list with zero documents and memories initially.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Associate Documents with Your Project">
Link documents from your drive to the project:

1. Open your project by clicking on it
2. Go to the "Documents" tab
3. Click "Add Documents"
4. Navigate the tree and select files or folders using checkboxes
5. Click "Confirm" to associate them

{/* SCREENSHOT: Document selector tree with checkboxes and selections */}

You can select individual files or entire folders - the hierarchy will be preserved in the project.

<Check>
The Documents tab should now show your associated documents with their processing status (pending → running → okay).
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Create a Memory">
Add contextual knowledge to your project:

1. Switch to the "Memories" tab in your project
2. Click "Add Memory"
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Project Guidelines")
4. Add content with key information, notes, or instructions
5. Click "Save"

{/* SCREENSHOT: Create memory dialog with sample content */}

Memories provide context that AI models can use when accessing your project through MCP servers.

Example memory content:
```
This project contains research materials for Q1 2024 analysis.

Key focus areas:
- Market trends and analysis
- Competitor research
- Budget planning documents

When analyzing these documents, prioritize recent data and cross-reference with budget constraints.
```

<Check>
Your memory should appear in the Memories tab with its content visible.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Generate an MCP Server API Key">
Create an API key to provide external applications with access to your project:

1. Go to the "MCP Servers" tab in your project
2. Click "Add MCP Server"
3. Enter a description (e.g., "Claude AI Integration")
4. Click "Generate"
5. **Important**: Copy the secret immediately - it's shown only once!

{/* SCREENSHOT: MCP server creation with secret display and copy button */}

<Warning>
The API secret is displayed only once upon creation. Copy it to a secure location immediately. You'll use this to authenticate requests to your project.
</Warning>

You'll receive:
- An API key ID
- A secret (copy this now!)
- An endpoint URL

<Check>
The MCP Servers tab should show your new API key with a masked secret (only the suffix visible) and the full endpoint URL ready to copy.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Your Setup">
Confirm everything is working:

1. **Documents**: Check that files appear in both your drive and project
2. **Memories**: Verify your memory is saved and readable
3. **MCP Server**: Ensure your API key is listed with its endpoint URL

{/* SCREENSHOT: Complete project dashboard showing all three tabs with data */}

<Check>
Your project dashboard should show:
- Document count > 0
- Memory count > 0
- MCP Server count > 0
</Check>
</Step>

</Steps>

## What You've Accomplished

In just a few minutes, you've:

- Uploaded and organized documents in your drive
- Created a project to group related content
- Associated documents with your project
- Added a memory to provide context
- Generated an MCP server API key for external access

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How many documents can I add to a project?">
There's no hard limit on documents per project. However, for best performance with AI interactions, consider organizing very large document sets across multiple focused projects.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use the same document in multiple projects?">
Yes! You can associate the same document from your drive with multiple projects. The document exists once in your drive but can provide context to multiple projects.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if I delete a document from my drive?">
If you delete a document from your drive, it will also be removed from any projects that reference it. Always check project associations before deleting important files.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I use the MCP server API key?">
Include the API key in the Authorization header of your HTTP requests as a Bearer token. See the [API Authentication guide](/features/memorylake/api-reference/authentication) for complete details and examples.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I revoke or regenerate API keys?">
Yes, you can delete API keys at any time from the MCP Servers tab. To rotate keys, create a new one and then delete the old one once you've updated all integrations.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Need Help?

- **Detailed Guides**: Explore the documentation sections for in-depth coverage of each feature
- **Troubleshooting**: Check the troubleshooting pages in each section for common issues
- **API Reference**: See the [API documentation](/features/memorylake/api-reference/overview) for programmatic access

<Tip>
Start small and expand gradually. You can always add more documents, create additional projects, and generate more API keys as your needs grow.
