## Overview

MemoryLake's advanced upload system handles files of any size with reliability and performance. Learn how to leverage multi-part uploads, concurrent transfers, and intelligent progress tracking for efficient file management.

## Upload Capabilities

### Multi-Part Upload

For large files, MemoryLake automatically uses multi-part upload technology:

**How It Works**:
1. Files larger than 100MB are automatically detected
2. The file is split into manageable chunks (typically 5-10MB each)
3. Chunks are uploaded in parallel
4. If a chunk fails, only that chunk is retried
5. Once all chunks complete, the file is assembled

**Benefits**:
- **Reliability**: Failed chunks can be retried without re-uploading the entire file
- **Speed**: Parallel chunk uploads utilize bandwidth more efficiently
- **Resumable**: Interrupted uploads can resume from the last successful chunk
- **Large File Support**: Upload files up to 500MB (or more depending on your plan)

<Tip>
Multi-part upload happens automatically. You don't need to configure anything - just upload your files normally.
</Tip>

### Chunk Size and Performance

| File Size | Chunk Size | Typical Chunks | Upload Time (10 Mbps) |
|-----------|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| 0-100 MB | N/A (single) | 1 | Varies |
| 100-250 MB | 5 MB | 20-50 | 2-5 min |
| 250-500 MB | 10 MB | 25-50 | 4-8 min |
| 500 MB+ | 10 MB | 50+ | 8+ min |

<Note>
Actual upload times vary based on your internet connection speed and server load.
</Note>

## Concurrent Uploads

### How Concurrent Upload Works

MemoryLake uploads up to **3 files simultaneously** to balance speed and resource usage:

1. **Queue Management**: All selected files are added to an upload queue
2. **Parallel Processing**: Up to 3 files upload at the same time
3. **Sequential Fallback**: Remaining files wait in queue and start as others complete
4. **Status Tracking**: Each file shows its individual status

**Upload States**:
- **Pending**: Waiting in queue
- **Uploading**: Currently transferring
- **Completed**: Successfully uploaded
- **Failed**: Error occurred (with retry option)

{/* SCREENSHOT: Upload queue showing multiple files in different states */}

### Optimizing Concurrent Uploads

**Best Practices**:
- Upload related files together for better organization
- Mix small and large files to keep all slots busy
- Monitor progress panel to identify any stuck uploads
- Retry failed uploads individually

**Why Only 3 Concurrent?**:
- Prevents browser resource exhaustion
- Avoids server overload
- Maintains stable upload speeds
- Allows effective progress monitoring

## Progress Tracking

### Upload Progress Panel

The progress panel shows real-time status for all uploads:

**Information Displayed**:
- File name and size
- Current status (pending, uploading, completed, failed)
- Progress percentage
- Upload speed (MB/s or KB/s)
- Time remaining estimate
- Success/error messages

{/* SCREENSHOT: Detailed progress panel with multiple uploads */}

### Progress States

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Pending">
**Appearance**: Queued, waiting to start

The file is in the queue but hasn't started uploading yet. It will begin once a concurrent slot becomes available.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Uploading">
**Appearance**: Progress bar filling, percentage increasing

The file is actively transferring. You'll see:
- Real-time progress percentage
- Current upload speed
- Estimated time remaining
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Completed">
**Appearance**: Green checkmark, 100% complete

Upload successful! The file is now available in your drive. The entry remains in the progress panel until you clear it.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Failed">
**Appearance**: Red error icon, error message

An error occurred during upload. Click the retry button to attempt the upload again. Common causes:
- Network interruption
- File size exceeded
- Invalid file type
- Server timeout
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Managing Upload Progress

**Actions Available**:
- **Pause**: Not currently supported (uploads run to completion)
- **Cancel**: Stop and remove an uploading file
- **Retry**: Restart a failed upload
- **Clear Completed**: Remove successful uploads from the panel
- **Clear All**: Remove all entries from the progress panel

<Warning>
Canceling an upload deletes any partial data. If you need to upload the file later, you'll start from the beginning.
</Warning>

## Folder Structure Preservation

### How It Works

When you upload a folder, MemoryLake maintains the complete directory structure:

**Example Local Structure**:
```
Research/
├── Papers/
│   ├── 2023/
│   │   ├── paper1.pdf
│   │   └── paper2.pdf
│   └── 2024/
│       └── paper3.pdf
├── Notes/
│   └── summary.md
└── Data/
    └── results.csv
```

**Resulting MemoryLake Structure**:
The exact same hierarchy is recreated in your drive, preserving all folders and file relationships.

{/* SCREENSHOT: Tree view showing preserved folder structure after upload */}

### Folder Upload Process

<Steps>
<Step title="Select Folder">
Use the "Upload Folder" option or drag an entire folder from your file explorer.
</Step>

<Step title="Analyze Structure">
MemoryLake scans the folder and builds an upload plan, identifying all files and subdirectories.
</Step>

<Step title="Create Folders">
All necessary folders are created in your drive first, maintaining the hierarchy.
</Step>

<Step title="Upload Files">
Files are uploaded concurrently, placed into their corresponding folders automatically.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Completion">
Check the progress panel to ensure all files completed successfully, then verify the structure in your tree.

<Check>
Navigate through the folders in your drive to confirm the structure matches your local copy.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Hidden File Filtering

MemoryLake automatically filters out hidden and system files:

**Skipped Files**:
- Files starting with `.` (dot files like `.DS_Store`, `.gitignore`)
- System files (Thumbs.db, desktop.ini)
- Temporary files

This keeps your drive clean and avoids uploading unnecessary files.

<Tip>
If you need to upload a dot file, rename it temporarily to not start with a dot, upload it, then rename it back in MemoryLake.
</Tip>

## Upload Optimization

### Best Practices for Large Uploads

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Preparing Your Files">
- Organize files locally before uploading
- Compress very large individual files if possible
- Remove unnecessary files from folders before upload
- Ensure stable internet connection
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="During Upload">
- Keep the browser tab open and active
- Avoid closing the browser or switching networks
- Monitor the progress panel for errors
- Upload during off-peak hours for better speed
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="After Upload">
- Verify all files completed successfully
- Check the tree structure matches your expectations

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network Considerations">
- Wired connections are more stable than WiFi
- Avoid uploading while streaming video or gaming
- Close unnecessary browser tabs
- Disable VPN if uploads are slow (if allowed by your policy)
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Upload Speed Factors

Factors affecting upload speed:
- **Internet Connection**: Your upload bandwidth is the primary limit
- **File Size**: Larger files benefit more from multi-part uploads
- **Server Load**: Peak times may have slower speeds
- **Geographic Distance**: Closer to data centers = faster uploads
- **Concurrent Uploads**: 3 files share your total bandwidth

**Typical Speeds**:
- **10 Mbps connection**: ~1 MB/s upload speed
- **50 Mbps connection**: ~6 MB/s upload speed
- **100 Mbps connection**: ~12 MB/s upload speed

<Note>
Your upload speed is typically much slower than your download speed. Check with your ISP for your actual upload bandwidth.
</Note>

## Error Handling

### Common Upload Errors

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="File Too Large">
**Error**: "File exceeds maximum size limit"

**Solution**:
- Check your plan's file size limit
- Compress the file if possible

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Server Error">
**Error**: "Server error (500)" or "Service unavailable"

**Solution**:
- Wait a few minutes and retry
- Check MemoryLake status page for outages
- Try uploading a smaller batch of files
- Contact support if problem persists
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Retry Strategy

If an upload fails:
1. **Check Error Message**: Understand what went wrong
2. **Fix the Issue**: Address network, file size, or format problems
3. **Retry Upload**: Use the retry button in the progress panel
4. **Monitor Closely**: Watch for the same error
5. **Alternative Approach**: Try uploading via API if UI continues to fail

## Advanced Techniques

### Uploading Via API

For programmatic or automated uploads, use the MemoryLake API:

```bash
# Single file upload
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/api/memorylake/api/v1/drives/items/{parentId}/children' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -F 'file=@/path/to/file.pdf' \
  -F 'name=file.pdf'
```

See the [Upload API documentation](/features/memorylake/api-reference/upload) for complete details.

### Bulk Upload Strategies

For uploading hundreds or thousands of files:
1. **Batch Uploads**: Upload in groups of 50-100 files at a time
2. **Overnight Uploads**: Start large uploads during off-hours
3. **Monitor Carefully**: Check progress regularly for errors
4. **Use Scripts**: Automate with API for reliability
5. **Verify Completion**: Check all files arrived correctly
