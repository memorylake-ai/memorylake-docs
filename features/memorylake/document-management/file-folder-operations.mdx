## Creating Folders

### Basic Folder Creation

You can create a new folder in several ways:
- Click the "New Folder" button in the toolbar

{/* SCREENSHOT: New folder button and context menu option */}
</Step>

<Step title="Enter Folder Name">
Type a descriptive name for your folder and press Enter or click Save.

<Tip>
Use clear, descriptive names that indicate the folder's contents. Good examples: "Q1-Reports", "Research-Papers", "Meeting-Notes".
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Creation">
The new folder appears in the tree immediately. You can now add files or create subfolders within it.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Folder Naming Guidelines

**Allowed Characters**:
- Letters (A-Z, a-z)
- Numbers (0-9)
- Hyphens and underscores (-, _)
- Spaces (converted to hyphens internally)

**Restrictions**:
- Cannot start with a dot (.)
- Cannot contain special characters: `/`, `\`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`
- Maximum length: 255 characters

<Warning>
Avoid using operating system reserved names like "CON", "PRN", "AUX", "NUL" on any platform.
</Warning>

## Uploading Files

### Single File Upload

<Step title="Click Upload Button">
Click the "Upload" button in the toolbar to open the file picker.

<Step title="Select File">
Choose a single file from your computer. Supported formats: .md, .txt, .csv, .pdf, .xlsx, .xls
</Step>

<Step title="Monitor Progress">
Watch the upload progress in the task panel. The file appears in your tree once the upload completes.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Multiple File Upload

<Steps>
<Step title="Select Multiple Files">
In the file picker, hold Ctrl (Windows/Linux) or Cmd (Mac) and click multiple files.
Or use Shift-click to select a range of files.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm Upload">
Click "Open" to start uploading all selected files concurrently.

{/* SCREENSHOT: Upload progress panel with multiple files */}
</Step>
</Steps>

### Folder Upload

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose Folder Upload Option">
In the upload dialog, look for "Upload Folder" or similar option (varies by browser).
</Step>

<Step title="Select Entire Folder">
Choose a folder from your computer. All files and subdirectories within it will be queued.
</Step>

<Step title="Preserve Structure">
MemoryLake automatically recreates the folder structure in your drive, maintaining the hierarchy.

{/* SCREENSHOT: Folder structure after upload showing preserved hierarchy */}

<Check>
Verify that the folder structure matches your local directory. All subfolders and files should be in the correct locations.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Drag-and-Drop Upload

The quickest way to upload files:

1. **Open File Explorer/Finder** on your computer
2. **Navigate to Your Files** - find the files or folders you want to upload
3. **Drag to MemoryLake** - drag and drop directly onto the tree view
4. **Drop on Target Folder** - drop onto a specific folder to upload there, or on empty space for root

{/* SCREENSHOT: Drag-and-drop operation in progress */}

<Tip>
Drag-and-drop supports both individual files and entire folders. This is often the fastest way to upload content.
</Tip>

## Renaming Items

### Rename Files or Folders

<Steps>
<Step title="Initiate Rename">
Right-click on the file or folder and select "Rename" from the context menu.

{/* SCREENSHOT: Context menu with rename option */}
</Step>

<Step title="Edit Name">
The name becomes editable. Type the new name.

<Note>
For files, you can change the name but the extension is preserved automatically.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Save Changes">
Press Enter to save or Escape to cancel. The item updates immediately in the tree.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Bulk Renaming

Currently, MemoryLake supports renaming items one at a time. For bulk operations, consider using the API.

## Moving Items

### Drag-and-Drop Move

The most intuitive way to move files and folders:

1. **Click and Hold** on the item you want to move
2. **Drag to Destination** folder
3. **Drop** when the target folder is highlighted
4. **Verify** the item now appears in the new location

{/* SCREENSHOT: Drag-and-drop move operation */}

<Tip>
You can move multiple items by selecting them first (if multi-select is supported), then dragging together.
</Tip>

### Move via Dialog

For more precise control:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Move Dialog">
Right-click the item and select "Move" from the context menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to Destination">
In the move dialog, browse the tree to find the destination folder.

{/* SCREENSHOT: Move dialog with folder tree selector */}
</Step>

<Step title="Select and Confirm">
Click on the destination folder and click "Move" to complete the operation.

<Check>
The item immediately appears in its new location and is removed from the old location.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Move Behavior

- **Folders**: Moving a folder moves all its contents
- **Permissions**: Moving doesn't affect project associations
- **Metadata**: Comments and extended attributes move with the item
- **Instant**: Moves happen immediately without copying

<Warning>
If you move a file that's associated with projects, the association is maintained but the path changes. Update any external references if needed.
</Warning>

## Downloading Files

### Download Single File

<Steps>
<Step title="Select File">
Click on a file in the tree to select it.
</Step>

<Step title="Download">
Right-click and select "Download" or click the download button in the toolbar.
</Step>

<Step title="Save Locally">
Your browser will download the file to your default downloads folder.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Download Folders

To download an entire folder:
- Right-click the folder and select "Download"
- The folder and its contents are packaged as a .zip file
- Extract the zip to access the files locally

<Note>
Large folders may take some time to package. You'll see a progress indicator while the download is prepared.
</Note>

## Deleting Items

### Delete Files or Folders

<Steps>
<Step title="Select Item to Delete">
Click on the file or folder you want to remove.
</Step>

<Step title="Initiate Delete">
Right-click and select "Delete" or press the Delete key.

{/* SCREENSHOT: Delete confirmation dialog */}
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm Deletion">
A confirmation dialog appears. Review the item name and click "Delete" to confirm.

<Warning>
Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Deleted items are not moved to a recycle bin.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Removal">
The item disappears from the tree immediately.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Deleting Folders with Contents

When you delete a folder:
- **All Contents Deleted**: All files and subfolders are permanently removed
- **Confirmation Required**: Extra confirmation for non-empty folders

<Warning>
Before deleting folders, check if any files are associated with important projects. Consider downloading a backup first.
