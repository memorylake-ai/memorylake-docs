## Overview

MemoryLake's tree view provides an intuitive interface for browsing your document hierarchy. Learn how to navigate efficiently with lazy loading, keyboard shortcuts, and visual organization features.

## Tree View Interface

{/* SCREENSHOT: Full tree view showing hierarchical structure */}

The tree view consists of several key components:

- **Tree Panel**: Left sidebar showing your folder hierarchy
- **Expand/Collapse Icons**: Click to show or hide folder contents
- **File/Folder Icons**: Visual indicators for item types
- **Resizable Divider**: Drag to adjust tree panel width
- **Main Content Area**: Shows details of the selected item

## Navigation Basics

### Expanding and Collapsing Folders

**Mouse Navigation**:
- Click the arrow icon next to a folder to expand it
- Click again to collapse
- Click the folder name to select without expanding

**Keyboard Navigation**:
- `→` (Right Arrow): Expand selected folder
- `←` (Left Arrow): Collapse selected folder
- `↑` (Up Arrow): Move to previous item
- `↓` (Down Arrow): Move to next item
- `Enter`: Expand folder or open file

<Tip>
Use keyboard navigation for faster browsing, especially when working with deeply nested folders.
</Tip>

### Lazy Loading

MemoryLake uses lazy loading to improve performance:

**How It Works**:
1. Folders show a collapse/expand icon but contents aren't loaded initially
2. When you expand a folder, MemoryLake fetches its children from the server
3. A loading indicator appears briefly while contents load
4. Once loaded, the folder's contents remain in memory until you refresh

**Benefits**:
- Faster initial page load
- Reduced memory usage
- Scales to handle thousands of files
- Server fetches only what you need

<Note>
If a folder's contents change (files added/removed), you may need to refresh or re-expand the folder to see updates.
</Note>

## Resizable Columns

### Adjusting Tree Panel Width

The tree panel width is adjustable to fit your workflow:

1. **Locate the Divider**: Find the vertical line between the tree and content area
2. **Hover**: The cursor changes to a resize indicator
3. **Drag**: Click and drag left or right to resize
4. **Release**: The new width is saved

**Width Constraints**:
- **Minimum**: 15% of screen width
- **Maximum**: 50% of screen width
- **Recommended**: 25-30% for most workflows

<Tip>
For deeply nested folders with long names, increase the tree panel width. For simple structures, minimize it to see more content.
</Tip>

## Visual Organization

### File and Folder Icons

Items display type-specific icons for quick identification:

| Type | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Folder | 📁 | Directory container |
| Markdown | 📝 | .md files |
| PDF | 📄 | .pdf documents |
| Excel | 📊 | .xlsx, .xls spreadsheets |
| Text | 📃 | .txt files |
| CSV | 📋 | .csv data files |
| Mount Point | 🔗 | External connector mount |

### Loading States

Visual feedback during operations:

- **Loading Folder**: Spinner icon while fetching contents
- **Uploading**: Progress indicator on parent folder
- **Error**: Red indicator if folder fails to load
- **Empty Folder**: Special icon or message for folders with no contents

{/* SCREENSHOT: Various loading and state indicators */}

### Selection Highlighting

- **Selected Item**: Highlighted with colored background
- **Hover State**: Subtle highlight when mouse hovers over items
- **Focus Indicator**: Keyboard focus shown with outline

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| `Home` | Jump to first item |
| `End` | Jump to last item |
| `Enter` | Open folder or file |
| `Backspace` | Go to parent folder |

### File Operations

| Shortcut | Action |

| `Ctrl/Cmd + R` | Refresh tree |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + [` | Collapse all folders |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + ]` | Expand to selected |

<Tip>
Print or bookmark this shortcut reference until you've memorized your most-used commands.
</Tip>

## Context Menu

Right-click any item to access the context menu:

{/* SCREENSHOT: Context menu with all available options */}

**File Context Menu**:
- Rename
- Move
- Download
- Delete
- Add to Project
- Edit Metadata/Comments
- Copy Path

**Folder Context Menu**:
- New Folder
- Rename
- Move
- Download (as .zip)
- Delete
- Add to Project
- Edit Metadata/Comments
- Upload Files Here

**Root/Empty Space Context Menu**:
- New Folder
- Upload Files
- Refresh Tree

## Advanced Navigation

### Breadcrumb Navigation

Breadcrumbs show your current location:
- Click any breadcrumb to jump to that folder
- Useful for quickly moving up multiple levels
- Always visible at the top of the content area

Example: `Root > Projects > Research > 2024 > Q1`

### Search and Filter

Find items quickly without manual navigation:

1. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + F` or use the search box
2. Type part of the file or folder name
3. Tree filters to show only matching items
4. Press `Esc` to clear filter and show all items

<Note>
Search filters the visible tree. Folders must be expanded for their contents to be searchable.
</Note>

### Jump to Item

If you know the item's path:
1. Use the "Jump to" or "Go to Path" feature
2. Enter the full path (e.g., `/Projects/Research/paper.pdf`)
3. The tree automatically expands and scrolls to that item

## Performance Tips

### Working with Large Trees

For drives with thousands of files:

- **Don't Expand Everything**: Keep folders collapsed unless needed
- **Use Search**: Find items without expanding every folder
- **Organize Logically**: Group files so you don't need to browse deep hierarchies
- **Lazy Loading**: Trust it - folders load quickly when expanded
- **Refresh Sparingly**: Only refresh when you know content changed

### Memory Management

The tree view manages memory efficiently:
- Collapsed folders unload from memory after inactivity
- Visible items stay cached for instant re-access
- Large folders paginate automatically
- Browser memory is monitored and optimized

<Tip>
If the interface becomes sluggish, collapse deep folder hierarchies or refresh the page to clear the cache.
</Tip>

## Accessibility

The tree view is designed for accessibility:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality without a mouse
- **Screen Readers**: ARIA labels for all tree nodes
- **High Contrast**: Works with high contrast modes
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear visual focus for keyboard users
- **Logical Tab Order**: Follows natural reading order

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Organizing for Navigation">
- Keep folder depth reasonable (3-5 levels maximum)
- Use clear, descriptive folder names
- Group related items together
- Create shortcuts or bookmarks for frequently accessed folders
- Consider flat structures over deep hierarchies when possible
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Efficient Navigation">
- Learn and use keyboard shortcuts
- Expand only the folders you need
- Use search for known file names
- Keep the tree panel width comfortable
- Refresh periodically if content changes frequently
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Visual Organization">
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Organize by date, category, or project
- Keep root level clean with minimal top-level folders
- Use metadata/comments instead of deeply nested structures
- Archive or delete unused files regularly
</Accordion>
