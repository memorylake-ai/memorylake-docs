## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Folder Organization">
- Use clear, descriptive folder names
- Group related documents together
- Avoid excessive nesting (3-5 levels is optimal)
- Create a consistent structure across similar projects
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="File Naming">
- Use descriptive names that indicate content
- Include dates in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) when relevant
- Avoid special characters that may cause issues
- Be consistent within a project or folder
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Metadata Usage">
- Add comments to documents that need context
- Use Markdown formatting for readability
- Include links to related documents
- Update comments when document purpose changes
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance Tips">
- Upload folders in batches rather than individual files
- Use folder upload to preserve structure
- Leverage lazy loading by not expanding all folders at once
- Clean up unused files regularly
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Start with a simple folder structure and expand as needed. It's easier to add complexity than to simplify an overly complex structure later.
