## Overview

This guide covers common problems you might encounter while managing documents in MemoryLake and provides practical solutions.

## Upload Issues

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Upload fails with 'File too large' error">
**Symptom**: Error message stating file exceeds size limit

**Causes**:
- File exceeds your plan's maximum file size
- Single-upload threshold exceeded but multi-part upload unavailable

**Solutions**:
1. Check your file size limit in account settings
2. Compress the file if possible (e.g., compress PDFs)
3. Split large files into smaller parts
4. Upgrade your plan for higher limits
5. Contact support for enterprise-level increases

<Tip>
Most plans support files up to 500MB with automatic multi-part upload for files over 100MB.
</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Upload stalls at 99% or specific percentage">
**Symptom**: Progress bar stops before completion

**Causes**:
- Network interruption
- Server processing time for large files
- Browser memory issues
- Antivirus scanning file

**Solutions**:
1. Wait 2-3 minutes - server may be processing
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Try a different browser
4. Disable antivirus temporarily
5. Use a wired connection instead of WiFi
6. Retry the upload if it fails completely

<Note>
Large files may appear stuck while the server assembles multi-part chunks. This is normal and can take 1-2 minutes.
</Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="'Invalid file type' error">
**Symptom**: Upload rejected due to file format

**Causes**:
- File extension not in supported list
- File has no extension
- Extension hidden or incorrect

**Solutions**:
1. Verify file is one of: .md, .txt, .csv, .pdf, .xlsx, .xls
2. Check the file extension is correct
3. Rename file to include proper extension
4. Convert file to a supported format
5. Check for hidden characters in filename

```bash
# Example: Check actual file type
file myfile.xyz
# If mismatch, rename: myfile.xyz → myfile.pdf
```
</Accordion>

**Solutions**:
1. Check upload progress panel for failed files
2. Verify all files are supported types

## Browser-Specific Issues

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Safari: Uploads fail randomly">
**Solution**: Update to latest Safari version or use Chrome/Firefox. Safari has known issues with large file uploads.

**Solution**: Check Firefox permissions. Go to Settings → Privacy & Security → Permissions and ensure MemoryLake has access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Chrome: Memory warnings">
