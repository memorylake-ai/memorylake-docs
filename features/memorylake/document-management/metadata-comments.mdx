description: "Add rich metadata and Markdown comments to your documents with live preview"
---

## Overview

Enhance your documents with rich contextual information using MemoryLake's metadata system. Add Markdown-formatted comments, store custom attributes, and provide context that helps both humans and AI understand your content.

## Extended Attributes (Metadata)

### What Are Extended Attributes?

Extended attributes (xattrs) are custom key-value pairs that you can attach to any file or folder. They store information about the item without modifying the file itself.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Document classification (e.g., `category: research`)
- Status tracking (e.g., `status: reviewed`)
- Custom tags (e.g., `tags: important,q1-2024`)
- Project metadata (e.g., `project-phase: planning`)

### Adding Extended Attributes

<Steps>
<Step title="Select Item">
Click on a file or folder in the tree to select it.
</Step>

<Step title="Open Metadata Panel">
Click the metadata icon or right-click and select "Edit Metadata".

The metadata panel opens on the right side of the screen.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Attributes">
Enter key-value pairs:
- **Key**: Attribute name (e.g., "category", "status")
- **Value**: Attribute value (e.g., "research", "draft")

Click "Add" to save the attribute.
</Step>

<Step title="Save Changes">
Click "Save" to persist all changes to the server.

<Check>
Your metadata is now stored with the file and will appear whenever you view the item.

## Markdown Comments

### Comment System Overview

MemoryLake's comment system uses Markdown, allowing you to create rich, formatted notes for any file or folder.

**Features**:
- **Markdown Formatting**: Headers, lists, bold, italic, code blocks, links
- **Live Preview**: See rendered output as you type
- **Auto-Save**: Draft protection prevents data loss
- **Version History**: Track comment changes over time (if enabled)

</Step>

<Step title="Preview Your Content">

## Comment Management

### Editing Comments

To modify an existing comment:
1. Select the file or folder
2. Open the comment panel
3. Edit the Markdown text
4. Save changes

<Note>
Some organizations enable comment versioning, allowing you to view previous versions. Check your organization settings.
</Note>

### Auto-Save and Drafts

MemoryLake automatically saves comment drafts:
- **Auto-Save Interval**: Every 30 seconds while editing
- **Draft Recovery**: If the browser closes, your draft is preserved
- **Reset Draft**: Use the "Reset" button to discard changes and revert to last saved version

<Tip>
Take advantage of auto-save to write long comments without worry. Your work is protected even if the connection is lost temporarily.
</Tip>

### Deleting Comments

To remove a comment entirely:
1. Open the comment editor
2. Delete all text
3. Click "Save"

The comment is removed from the file, though version history may retain previous versions.

<Warning>
Deleting comments is permanent (unless version history is enabled). Consider adding a "DEPRECATED" header instead if you might need the information later.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Writing Effective Comments">
**Do**:
- Be concise but complete
- Use headers to organize long comments
- Include context others might not have
- Link to related documents
- Update comments when content changes

**Don't**:
- Write novel-length comments (keep it scannable)
- Include sensitive information in comments on shared files
- Duplicate information that's in the file itself
- Leave outdated comments
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Organizing with Metadata">
**Folder Metadata**:
- Use `project` attribute to link folders to projects
- Add `status` to track folder lifecycle (active/archived)
- Include `owner` for accountability

**File Metadata**:
- `category` for classification (report/research/data)
- `version` for version tracking
- `reviewed-by` for approval workflows
- `last-updated` for freshness tracking
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Markdown Formatting Tips">
- Use `#` headers to create structure
- Lists make content scannable
- **Bold** key terms for quick identification
- Code blocks for technical content
- Tables for structured data
- Links to connect related documents
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Accessibility">
- Use headers in hierarchical order (H1, then H2, not H1 then H3)
- Provide descriptive link text (not "click here")
- Add alt text for any images
- Keep language clear and simple
- Use lists for better screen reader support
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integration with Projects

Comments and metadata enhance project workflows:

- **Project Context**: Comments provide context when documents are associated with projects
- **AI Understanding**: AI models accessing via MCP servers can read comments to understand document purpose
- **Team Collaboration**: Comments help team members understand document relationships and history
- **Search**: Metadata and comments are searchable, making documents easier to find

## Advanced Use Cases

### Documentation as Code

Store markdown documentation directly as comments:
```markdown
# API Endpoint Documentation

## GET /api/users/{id}

**Description**: Retrieves user details by ID

**Parameters**:
- `id` (required): User ID (UUID format)

**Response**: 200 OK
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "name": "string",
  "email": "string"
}
```

**Error Codes**:
- 404: User not found
- 401: Unauthorized
```

### Knowledge Management

Create a knowledge base within comments:
- **Lessons Learned**: Document what worked and what didn't
- **Decision Records**: Explain why choices were made
- **Process Documentation**: Describe workflows and procedures
- **Troubleshooting**: Include solutions to common problems

### Cross-Referencing

Link documents together in comments:
```markdown
## Related Documents
- [Design Specs](/projects/redesign/specs.md) - Latest design specifications
- [Requirements](/projects/redesign/requirements.pdf) - Original requirements document
- [Budget](/finance/q1-budget.xlsx) - Budget allocation
```
