## Viewing Memories

### Memory List

The Memories tab shows all memories for a project:
- Memory name
- Content preview (first 3 lines)
- Created timestamp
- Last updated timestamp
- Actions (view, edit, delete)

{/* SCREENSHOT: Memories list with multiple items */}

### View Full Memory

To see complete memory content:
1. Click on memory name or view icon
2. Dialog shows full content
3. Close when done

{/* SCREENSHOT: View memory dialog */}

## Memory Operations

### Edit Memory

1. Click edit icon for the memory
2. Modify name and/or content
3. Save changes

See [Creating & Editing Memories](/features/memorylake/memories/creating-memories) for details.

### Delete Memory

<Warning>
Deleting a memory is permanent. The memory is removed from the project and AI models will no longer have access to it.
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step title="Select Memory">
Click delete icon for the memory to remove.

{/* SCREENSHOT: Delete confirmation dialog */}
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm Deletion">
Review memory name and click "Delete" to confirm.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Removal">
Memory disappears from list immediately.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Search/Filter

If your project has many memories:
- Use browser search (Ctrl/Cmd + F) to find specific text
- Scan memory names for quick identification
- Review content previews

<Tip>
Give memories descriptive names so you can find them easily later.
</Tip>

## Memory Organization

### Naming Strategy

Use consistent naming patterns:

**By Topic**:
- "Architecture - Overview"
- "Architecture - Database Design"
- "Architecture - API Structure"

**By Type**:
- "[Guidelines] Code Style"
- "[Context] Project History"
- "[Reference] Related Projects"

**By Priority**:
- "IMPORTANT: Budget Constraints"
- "Key Finding: Customer Preference"
- "Note: Technical Limitation"

### Content Organization

Within memory content:
- Start with most important information
- Use consistent formatting
- Include headers or sections
- Add line breaks for readability

## Bulk Operations

Currently no bulk operations supported. To manage multiple memories:
- Edit/delete one at a time
- Consider using API for bulk operations
- Plan memory structure before creating many

## Memory Metadata

Each memory tracks:
- **Created At**: When memory was first created
- **Updated At**: Last modification timestamp
- **Name**: Memory title
- **Content**: Full text
- **Project ID**: Parent project

## Integration with Other Features

### Projects

Memories are project-scoped:
- Each memory belongs to one project
- Deleting project deletes its memories
- Memories provide context for project documents

### MCP Servers

AI models accessing via MCP servers can read memories:
- Memories provide guidelines for AI behavior
- Context helps AI understand documents
- Memories remain private to authorized API keys

### Documents

Memories complement documents:
- Documents provide content
- Memories provide interpretation and context
- Together they give complete picture to AI
