## Overview

Memories are knowledge snippets that provide context for your projects. Store notes, guidelines, and information that helps both humans and AI understand your project.

## What Are Memories?

Memories are:
- **Text-based** knowledge snippets
- **Project-scoped** contextual information
- **AI-accessible** via MCP servers
- **Searchable** and manageable

## Memory Content Guidelines

### What to Include

**Good Memory Content**:
- Context about the project
- Guidelines for AI interactions
- Key decisions and rationale
- Important facts and figures
- Lessons learned
- References to related information

**Example**:
```
This project analyzes customer feedback from Q1 2024.

Key objectives:
- Identify trending pain points
- Measure sentiment changes over time
- Recommend product improvements

When analyzing, prioritize recent feedback and cross-reference with NPS scores.

Related projects: Q4 2023 Analysis, Customer Satisfaction Study
```

### Length Considerations

- **Concise**: Aim for 100-500 words per memory
- **Focused**: One topic or theme per memory
- **Scannable**: Use line breaks for readability
- **Multiple Memories**: Better to create several focused memories than one long one

<Tip>
Think of memories as index cards - each should contain a single coherent piece of information.
</Tip>

### Structure

Use clear structure in your memory content:

```
**Purpose**: What this project is about

**Context**: Background information

**Guidelines**: How to approach the content

**Important Notes**: Key things to remember
```

### Clarity

- Use simple, clear language
- Avoid jargon unless necessary
- Define terms that might be ambiguous
- Be specific rather than vague

## Memory Organization

### Naming Strategy

Use consistent naming patterns:

**By Topic**:
- "Architecture - Overview"
- "Architecture - Database Design"
- "Architecture - API Structure"

**By Type**:
- "[Guidelines] Code Style"
- "[Context] Project History"
- "[Reference] Related Projects"

**By Priority**:
- "IMPORTANT: Budget Constraints"
- "Key Finding: Customer Preference"
- "Note: Technical Limitation"

### Content Organization

Within memory content:
- Start with most important information
- Use consistent formatting
- Include headers or sections
- Add line breaks for readability
