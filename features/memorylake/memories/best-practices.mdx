## Writing Effective Memories

### Be Specific and Concrete

**Bad**:
```
This project is about customer data.
```

**Good**:
```
This project analyzes Q1 2024 customer survey responses from 1,500 participants.

Focus areas:
- Net Promoter Score trends
- Product satisfaction ratings  
- Feature request themes

Survey methodology: Online survey, random sampling, 95% confidence interval
```

### Provide Context

Help readers (human and AI) understand:
- Why this project exists
- What problem it solves
- Who the audience is
- How it relates to other projects

### Use Clear Structure

Organize content with sections:

```
PURPOSE
Brief description of project goals

CONTEXT
Background information

KEY INFORMATION
Important facts, figures, decisions

GUIDELINES
How to approach the content

RELATED
Links to related projects or external resources
```

## Naming Conventions

### Descriptive Names

Make names self-explanatory:
- ✅ "Budget Constraints Q1 2024"
- ✅ "Customer Interview - Key Insights"
- ❌ "Notes 1"
- ❌ "Misc"

### Consistent Patterns

Choose a pattern and stick to it:

**Topic-Based**:
- "Research Methodology"
- "Research Questions"
- "Research Timeline"

**Category Prefixes**:
- "[Context] Project History"
- "[Guidelines] Analysis Approach"
- "[Reference] Related Studies"

## Content Guidelines

### Length

**Ideal**: 100-500 words per memory

**Too Short** (< 50 words):
```
Project about sales data.
```
Not enough context for AI or collaborators.

**Too Long** (> 1000 words):
Hard to scan, better split into multiple focused memories.

**Just Right**:
```
This project analyzes sales data from our Q4 2023 campaign across three regions: North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.

Objectives:
1. Compare regional performance against targets
2. Identify top-performing products  
3. Understand seasonal trends
4. Recommend Q1 2024 strategies

Data sources: CRM exports, Google Analytics, manual sales reports

When analyzing, focus on year-over-year growth rather than absolute numbers, as we expanded team size significantly in 2023.

```

### Update Regularly

Memories should stay current:
- Update when information changes
- Add new insights as project progresses
- Remove outdated information
- Archive historical context separately

## Use Cases by Memory Type

### Project Guidelines

Provide instructions for working with the project:

```
ANALYSIS GUIDELINES

When reviewing these documents:
1. Prioritize data from the last 6 months
2. Cross-reference customer feedback with NPS scores
3. Focus on actionable insights over descriptive statistics
4. Consider budget constraints ($50K for Q1)

Red flags to watch for:
- Sample sizes under 100
- Survey response rates under 30%
- Conflicting data between sources
```

### Background Context

Explain project history:

```
PROJECT HISTORY

This project began in September 2023 after customer complaints about checkout process increased 40%.

Initial hypothesis: Payment gateway issues causing abandonment

Investigation revealed:
- Gateway was fine
- UI confusion was main culprit
- Mobile experience particularly poor

This analysis supports the redesign project (see "Checkout Redesign 2024")
```

### Key Decisions

Document important choices:

```
TECHNICAL DECISIONS

Why we chose PostgreSQL over MySQL:
- Better JSON support for flexible schemas
- Superior full-text search
- Team expertise
- Cost-effective at our scale

Trade-offs accepted:
- Slightly more complex setup
- Fewer hosting options

Decision date: January 15, 2024
Decision makers: Engineering team, CTO approval
```

### Constraints and Limitations

Note boundaries:

```
PROJECT CONSTRAINTS

Budget: $75,000 (hard limit)
Timeline: Must complete by March 31, 2024
Team: 3 developers, 1 designer (part-time)
Scope: MVP only - advanced features for Phase 2

Known Limitations:
- Data only available from 2022 forward
- API rate limited to 1000 requests/hour
- No access to competitor pricing data
```

## Integration with MCP Servers

When memories will be read by AI models:

### Be Explicit

AI doesn't have implicit context:

**Vague**:
```
Focus on the important stuff.
```

**Explicit**:
```
When analyzing documents:
1. Prioritize files in /reports/final/ over /drafts/
2. Pay special attention to customer quotes (marked with >>)
3. Ignore internal process notes (in /admin/ folders)
```

### Provide Examples

Help AI understand expectations:

```
RESPONSE STYLE

When answering questions about this project, use this style:

Example good response:
"According to the Q1 report (page 12), customer satisfaction increased 15% after implementing the new checkout flow. This aligns with the NPS improvement documented in the March survey."

Example poor response:
"Things got better."

Always cite specific documents and page numbers when available.
```

## Maintenance

### Regular Review

Schedule memory review:
- Monthly for active projects
- Quarterly for stable projects
- Before sharing project with new team members
- After major project milestones

### Keep It Current

Update memories when:
- Project goals change
- New constraints emerge
- Key decisions are made
- Important lessons are learned
- Related projects launch

### Archive Old Content

Rather than deleting historical information:
- Create "Archive - [Date]" memories
- Move outdated content there
- Keep active memories current

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too vague**: "This is an important project"  
✅ **Specific**: "This project determines Q2 budget allocation based on Q1 results"

❌ **Kitchen sink**: One memory with everything  
✅ **Focused**: Multiple memories, each with clear purpose

❌ **Stale**: Last updated 2 years ago  
✅ **Current**: Updated as project evolves

❌ **Internal jargon**: "Use the TPS reports for the Q-analysis"  
✅ **Clear**: "Use the Transaction Processing System reports for quarterly analysis"

❌ **No structure**: Wall of text  
✅ **Organized**: Clear sections with line breaks
