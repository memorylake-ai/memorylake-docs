## Memory Content Guidelines

### What to Include

**Good Memory Content**:
- Context about the project
- Guidelines for AI interactions
- Key decisions and rationale
- Important facts and figures
- Lessons learned
- References to related information

**Example**:
```
This project analyzes customer feedback from Q1 2024.

Key objectives:
- Identify trending pain points
- Measure sentiment changes over time
- Recommend product improvements

When analyzing, prioritize recent feedback and cross-reference with NPS scores.

```

### Length Considerations

- **Concise**: Aim for 100-500 words per memory
- **Focused**: One topic or theme per memory
- **Scannable**: Use line breaks for readability
- **Multiple Memories**: Better to create several focused memories than one long one

<Tip>
Think of memories as index cards - each should contain a single coherent piece of information.
</Tip>

## Content Best Practices

### Structure

Use clear structure in your memory content:

```
**Purpose**: What this project is about

**Context**: Background information

**Guidelines**: How to approach the content

**Important Notes**: Key things to remember
```

### Clarity

- Use simple, clear language
- Avoid jargon unless necessary
- Define terms that might be ambiguous
- Be specific rather than vague

### Relevance

- Keep content focused on the project
- Update memories when information changes
- Remove outdated memories
- Link to related memories or documents
