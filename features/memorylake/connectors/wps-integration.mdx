## Overview

WPS (Kingsoft Office) integration allows you to access your WPS document libraries directly within MemoryLake. This guide walks through the complete setup process.

## Prerequisites

- Active WPS account
- Document libraries in your WPS workspace
- Administrative access to connect services (if required by your organization)

## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>

<Step title="Open WPS Connector">
Navigate to the Connectors section in MemoryLake and click on the WPS connector card.

{/* SCREENSHOT: WPS connector card in connectors section */}
</Step>

<Step title="Initiate OAuth Flow">
Click "Connect" or "Login with WPS". A new window opens to WPS's authorization page.

{/* SCREENSHOT: OAuth window with WPS login screen */}

<Tip>
Ensure pop-ups are enabled for MemoryLake. The OAuth flow uses a popup window.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Authenticate with WPS">
Log in to your WPS account using your credentials.
- Enter your WPS email/username
- Enter your password
- Complete any two-factor authentication if enabled
</Step>

<Step title="Grant Permissions">
Review the permissions MemoryLake is requesting:
- Read access to your document libraries
- Access to file metadata

Click "Authorize" or "Allow" to grant access.

<Note>
MemoryLake requests read-only access. We cannot modify or delete your WPS documents.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Select Document Libraries">
After authorization, a dialog shows your available WPS document libraries.

{/* SCREENSHOT: Document library selector with checkboxes */}

- **View all libraries**: Your personal and shared libraries appear
- **Select libraries**: Check the boxes for libraries you want to mount
- **Multi-select**: You can select multiple libraries at once
</Step>

<Step title="Create Mount Points">
Click "Connect" to create mount points for selected libraries.

MemoryLake creates a folder structure:
```
Root/
└── WPS Space/
    ├── Library 1/
    ├── Library 2/
    └── Library 3/
```

{/* SCREENSHOT: WPS Space folder in tree with mounted libraries */}

<Check>
The "WPS Space" folder appears in your drive with each selected library as a subfolder.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Browse WPS Content">
Navigate into the WPS Space folders to browse your WPS documents.

- Expand folders to see contents
- Download files for local use
- Associate with projects for AI context
</Step>

</Steps>

## Managing WPS Connections

### View Connection Status

The connector card shows connection status:
- **Connected**: Green indicator, libraries mounted
- **Available**: Ready to connect
- **Error**: Red indicator, connection issue

### Add More Libraries

To mount additional libraries:
1. Open WPS connector settings
2. Click "Manage Connections"
3. Select additional libraries
4. Click "Connect"

### Remove Connections

To unmount specific libraries:
1. Go to WPS connector settings
2. View connected libraries
3. Click "Remove" next to the library
4. Confirm removal

The library disappears from WPS Space but your WPS account remains connected.

### Revoke Authorization

To completely disconnect WPS:
1. Open WPS connector settings
2. Click "Revoke Authorization"
3. Confirm revocation

All WPS libraries are unmounted and MemoryLake loses access to your WPS account.

<Warning>
Revoking authorization removes all WPS mount points. Files associated with projects will become inaccessible.
</Warning>

## Working with WPS Documents

### Browsing WPS Files

Navigate WPS libraries like regular MemoryLake folders:
- Click folders to expand
- View file lists
- See file metadata

{/* SCREENSHOT: WPS document library expanded showing files */}

### Downloading WPS Files

To download a WPS file:
1. Navigate to the file in WPS Space
2. Right-click the file
3. Select "Download"
4. File downloads to your local machine

<Note>
Downloaded files are copies. Changes to local copies don't sync back to WPS.
</Note>

### Associating with Projects

WPS files can be associated with projects:
1. Open a project
2. Go to Documents tab
3. Click "Add Documents"
4. Navigate into WPS Space
5. Select WPS files or folders
6. Confirm

AI models accessing via MCP servers can now read context from WPS documents.

### Limitations

WPS-mounted content is **read-only**:
- ✅ Browse folder structure
- ✅ Download files
- ✅ Associate with projects
- ✅ Search content
- ❌ Upload new files
- ❌ Edit existing files
- ❌ Delete files
- ❌ Rename or move files

<Tip>
To modify WPS documents, use the WPS application directly. Changes appear in MemoryLake after refreshing.
</Tip>

## Refreshing WPS Content

WPS content doesn't auto-refresh. To see latest changes:
1. Collapse the WPS Space folder
2. Re-expand to trigger reload
3. Or refresh the entire page

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="OAuth window doesn't open">
**Solutions**:
- Enable pop-ups for MemoryLake domain
- Check browser popup blocker settings
- Try different browser
- Disable browser extensions temporarily
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No document libraries appear">
**Solutions**:
- Verify you have libraries in your WPS account
- Check WPS account permissions
- Try logging out of WPS and back in
- Contact WPS support if libraries are missing
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Connection fails after authorization">
**Solutions**:
- Check internet connection
- Wait a few minutes and retry
- Revoke and re-authorize
- Check MemoryLake service status
- Contact support with error message
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="WPS files won't download">
**Solutions**:
- Verify file size isn't too large
- Check WPS permissions for the file
- Try downloading from WPS directly first
- Check browser download settings
- Ensure sufficient local disk space
</Accordion>

## Security & Privacy

- **OAuth 2.0**: Industry-standard secure authentication
