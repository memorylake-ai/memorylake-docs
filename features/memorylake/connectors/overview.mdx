## Overview

MemoryLake Connectors enable you to integrate external document services directly into your workspace. Access files from WPS, Dropbox, Feishu, and other services without leaving MemoryLake.

## What Are Connectors?

Connectors are integrations that:
- **Mount external document libraries** into your drive
- **Use OAuth authentication** for secure access
- **Provide read-only access** to external content
- **Preserve folder structure** from external services
- **Support multiple services** through extensible framework

## How Connectors Work

### Authentication Flow

1. **Initiate Connection**: Click on a connector card
2. **OAuth Authentication**: Redirected to service's login page
3. **Grant Permissions**: Approve MemoryLake access
4. **Select Resources**: Choose which libraries/folders to mount
5. **Create Mount Points**: External content appears in your drive

### Mount Points

Connected services appear as special folders in your drive:
- Located in dedicated connector folder (e.g., "WPS Space")
- Marked with connector icon
- Read-only access (download only)
- Respect external service permissions

## Connector Capabilities

### What You Can Do

- **Browse** external document structures
- **Download** files from external services
- **Associate** with projects (for AI context)
- **Search** within mounted content
- **View** metadata from external service

### Limitations

- **Read-Only**: Cannot upload, edit, or delete through MemoryLake
- **Sync Direction**: One-way (external → MemoryLake)
- **Real-Time**: Changes in external service require refresh
- **File Types**: Limited to MemoryLake-supported formats

<Note>
To modify files in external services, use the native application. MemoryLake provides convenient read access and integration with your projects.
