## Overview

MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers provide API endpoints for external applications and AI models to access your project data securely.

## What Are MCP Servers?

MCP Servers in MemoryLake are:
- **API Key Endpoints**: Authenticated URLs for external access
- **Project-Scoped**: Each API key provides access to one project
- **Read-Only**: External access cannot modify your data
- **Secure**: API secrets shown only once upon creation

## Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="AI Model Integration">
Provide AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) with read access to your project's documents and memories.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="External Applications">
Build custom applications that query your knowledge base programmatically.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Team Access">
Generate API keys for team members to access project data from their tools.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Automation">
Create automated workflows that read project data for reporting or analysis.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Generate API Key">
Create an API key for your project with optional description.
</Step>

<Step title="Copy Secret">
**Important**: Copy the API secret immediately - it's shown only once!
</Step>

<Step title="Use Endpoint">
Use the provided endpoint URL with your API key to access project data.
</Step>

<Step title="Secure Storage">
Store your API secret securely (never commit to version control).
</Step>
</Steps>

## What MCP Servers Provide Access To

When you use an API key, external applications can read:
- **Associated documents**: File list and contents
- **Memories**: All memories in the project
- **Document comments**: Comments attached to files

<Warning>
MCP servers provide read-only access. External applications cannot modify, delete, or upload content.
</Warning>
