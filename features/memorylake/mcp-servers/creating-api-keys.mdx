## Creating an API Key

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Project">
Navigate to the project dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Go to MCP Servers Tab">
Click the "MCP Servers" tab.

{/* SCREENSHOT: MCP Servers tab */}
</Step>

<Step title="Click Add MCP Server">
Click the "Add MCP Server" button.

{/* SCREENSHOT: Create MCP server dialog */}
</Step>

<Step title="Enter Description">
Provide a description for this API key (optional but recommended):
- "Claude AI Integration"
- "Production API Access"
- "Team Member - John"
- "Analytics Dashboard"

This helps you identify keys later.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate Key">
Click "Generate" or "Create" to create the API key.
</Step>

<Step title="Copy Secret Immediately">
**CRITICAL**: The API secret appears in a dialog. This is the ONLY time you'll see it!

{/* SCREENSHOT: Secret display with copy button and warning */}

- Click "Copy" to copy the secret to clipboard
- Save it in a secure location (password manager, environment variables)
- Never commit it to version control

<Warning>
Once you close this dialog, the full secret cannot be retrieved again. If lost, you must delete and recreate the API key.
</Warning>

<Check>
You should have copied and securely stored the API secret.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Note the Endpoint URL">
The dialog also shows the endpoint URL:

```
https://api.example.com/api/memorylake/mcp/v1/projects/{project_id}
```

Copy this URL for use in your applications.

</Steps>

## API Key Components

When you create an API key, you receive:

### 1. API Key ID
- Unique identifier for the key
- Visible in the MCP Servers list
- Used for management (deleting the key)

### 2. API Secret (Shown Once)
- Full secret string (e.g., `mlk_secret_abc123xyz...`)
- Used for authentication in API requests
- **Never shown again after initial creation**
- Only last 4 characters visible in list (e.g., `...xyz`)

### 3. Endpoint URL
- Full URL for making API requests
- Includes the project ID
- Use with Authorization header

### 4. Description (Optional)
- Your custom description
- Helps identify purpose of the key
- Can be edited later (check docs)

## Using Your API Key

### Authentication Header

Include your API key in requests:

```bash
curl -X GET '{endpoint_url}' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer mlk_secret_abc123xyz...' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

### Example Request

```bash
# Get project details
curl -X GET 'https://api.example.com/api/memorylake/mcp/v1/projects/proj_123' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_SECRET_HERE'
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "proj_123",
    "name": "Research Project",
    "description": "Q1 2024 research materials",
    "documentCount": 15,
    "memoryCount": 5
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Descriptive Names

Use clear descriptions:
- ✅ "Production - Claude Integration"
- ✅ "Development - Testing"
- ✅ "Analytics Dashboard - Read Only"
- ❌ "Key 1"
- ❌ "Test"

### Secure Storage

Store API secrets securely:
- **Password Manager**: 1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden
- **Environment Variables**: `.env` files (add to `.gitignore`)
- **Secrets Manager**: AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault
- **DO NOT**: Commit to Git, store in code, share in chat/email

### Multiple Keys

Create separate keys for different purposes:
- One per environment (dev, staging, production)
- One per team member (for accountability)
- One per integration (Claude, custom app, analytics)

This allows you to revoke specific access without affecting others.

### Key Rotation

Rotate keys periodically:
1. Create new API key
2. Update applications to use new key
3. Verify new key works
4. Delete old API key

## Managing API Keys

### View API Keys

The MCP Servers tab lists all API keys:
- Description
- Created date
- Status
- Masked secret (last 4 characters)
- Actions (delete)

{/* SCREENSHOT: MCP servers list with multiple keys */}

### Delete API Key

To revoke access:
1. Click delete icon for the key
2. Confirm deletion

{/* SCREENSHOT: Delete confirmation */}

Access is revoked immediately.

<Warning>
Deleting an API key immediately revokes access. Applications using that key will receive 401 Unauthorized errors.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Forgot to copy secret">
**Solution**: You must delete the API key and create a new one. Secrets cannot be retrieved after creation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="API key not working">
**Solutions**:
- Verify you're using the full secret (not just the masked version)
- Check Authorization header format: `Bearer YOUR_SECRET`
- Ensure project ID in URL is correct
- Verify key hasn't been deleted
- Check for typos in secret
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Want to see full secret again">
**Not Possible**: Secrets shown only once for security. Delete and recreate if lost.
</Accordion>
