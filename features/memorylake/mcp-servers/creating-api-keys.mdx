## Creating an API Key

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Project">
Navigate to the project dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Go to MCP Servers Tab">
Click the "MCP Servers" tab.

{/* SCREENSHOT: MCP Servers tab */}
</Step>

<Step title="Click Add MCP Server">
Click the "Add MCP Server" button.

{/* SCREENSHOT: Create MCP server dialog */}
</Step>

<Step title="Enter Description">
Provide a description for this API key (optional but recommended):
- "Claude AI Integration"
- "Production API Access"
- "Team Member - John"
- "Analytics Dashboard"

This helps you identify keys later.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate Key">
Click "Generate" or "Create" to create the API key.
</Step>

<Step title="Copy Secret Immediately">
**CRITICAL**: The API secret appears in a dialog. This is the ONLY time you'll see it!

{/* SCREENSHOT: Secret display with copy button and warning */}

- Click "Copy" to copy the secret to clipboard
- Save it in a secure location (password manager, environment variables)
- Never commit it to version control

<Warning>
Once you close this dialog, the full secret cannot be retrieved again. If lost, you must delete and recreate the API key.
</Warning>

<Check>
You should have copied and securely stored the API secret.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Note the Endpoint URL">
The dialog also shows the endpoint URL:

```
https://ai.data.cloud/memorylake/mcp/v1?apikey=...
```

Copy this URL for use in your applications.

## Best Practices

### Descriptive Names

Use clear descriptions:
- ✅ "Production - Claude Integration"
- ✅ "Development - Testing"
- ✅ "Analytics Dashboard - Read Only"
- ❌ "Key 1"
- ❌ "Test"

### Secure Storage

Store API secrets securely:
- **Password Manager**: 1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden
- **Environment Variables**: `.env` files (add to `.gitignore`)
- **Secrets Manager**: AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault
- **DO NOT**: Commit to Git, store in code, share in chat/email

### Multiple Keys

Create separate keys for different purposes:
- One per environment (dev, staging, production)
- One per team member (for accountability)
- One per integration (Claude, custom app, analytics)

This allows you to revoke specific access without affecting others.

### Key Rotation

Rotate keys periodically:
1. Create new API key
2. Update applications to use new key
3. Verify new key works
4. Delete old API key

## Managing API Keys

### Delete API Key

To revoke access:
1. Click delete icon for the key
2. Confirm deletion

{/* SCREENSHOT: Delete confirmation */}

Access is revoked immediately.

<Warning>
Deleting an API key immediately revokes access. Applications using that key will receive 401 Unauthorized errors.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Want to see full secret again">
