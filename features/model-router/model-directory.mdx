---

## What You Can Do
- List models and channels available to the current token with one click, clarifying what can be used.
- View model metadata such as source, owned_by, pricing, etc., for frontend display and cost estimation.
- Choose the corresponding list interface for different protocols: `/v1/models`, `/claude/v1/models`, `/gemini/*/models`.

## Use Cases
- Confirm available models before integration to avoid calling non-existent or unenabled targets.
- Pull model lists for frontend or configuration centers for dropdown selection or pricing hints.
- View available models separately in multi-team/multi-token scenarios to avoid cross-usage.

## Quick Start
1) Prepare a token generated from the [console](https://app.memorylake.ai/panel/token), ensuring the group has enabled target models and quotas.  
2) Call the corresponding model list interface according to the protocol used.  
3) Read metadata such as `id`, `owned_by`, pricing, etc., from the returned results to decide which model to call.

## Request Examples

### OpenAI-Compatible Model List
<CodeGroup>
```ts TypeScript
await fetch("https://app.memorylake.ai/v1/models", {
  headers: { "Authorization": "Bearer sk-demo123" }
});
```
```py Python
import requests

resp = requests.get(
    "https://app.memorylake.ai/v1/models",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer sk-demo123"}
)
```
```bash cURL
curl https://app.memorylake.ai/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-demo123"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Claude Model List
<CodeGroup>
```ts TypeScript
await fetch("https://app.memorylake.ai/claude/v1/models", {
  headers: { "Authorization": "Bearer sk-demo123" }
});
```
```py Python
import requests

resp = requests.get(
    "https://app.memorylake.ai/claude/v1/models",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer sk-demo123"}
)
```
```bash cURL
curl https://app.memorylake.ai/claude/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-demo123"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Gemini Model List
<CodeGroup>
```ts TypeScript
await fetch("https://app.memorylake.ai/gemini/v1beta/models", {
  headers: { "Authorization": "Bearer sk-demo123" }
});
```
```py Python
import requests

resp = requests.get(
    "https://app.memorylake.ai/gemini/v1beta/models",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer sk-demo123"}
)
```
```bash cURL
curl https://app.memorylake.ai/gemini/v1beta/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-demo123"
```
</CodeGroup>

## Key Return Fields
- `id`: Model identifier, used for the `model` field in subsequent requests.
- `owned_by`: Model ownership or source, convenient for displaying source channels in the interface.
- Pricing metadata: Used for display and cost estimation; actual billing is based on settlement results.
- Availability: Only returns models available to the current token; unenabled models will not appear in the list.

## Usage Recommendations
- Pull the model list before calling, then bind it to frontend selectors to avoid hardcoding model names.
- If you need to pass through OpenAI ecosystem capabilities (Files/Fine-tuning/Assistants/Threads/Batches/Vector Stores), first confirm that corresponding channels are enabled and visible in the list.
- For multi-team/multi-application scenarios, use respective tokens to pull lists separately to avoid exposing unavailable models to incorrect callers.

## Boundaries and Prerequisites
- Available models, sources, and pricing are based on console and token group configuration; unenabled models will not appear in the list.
- Pricing and owned_by come from the model directory response; billing is based on actual settlement results.
- The list only reflects current token availability; model online/offline or permission changes require re-fetching.
