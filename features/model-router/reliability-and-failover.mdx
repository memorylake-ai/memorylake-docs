description: "Automatic retry, channel switching, and streaming fallback to reduce impact of exceptions and rate limiting"
---

## Core Capabilities (Summary)
- When encountering 429 or upstream exceptions, the platform automatically retries and switches to enabled and healthy channels.
- Streaming calls provide heartbeat and exception fallback, automatically closing connections on exceptions to avoid hanging.
- Dynamic rate limiting guardrails peak-shave during high concurrency to protect main routes and task interfaces.

## How to Use
- Before use: In the model directory, confirm that the token can see multiple channels (if not configured, contact an administrator).  
- During calls: Normally use `/v1`, `/claude/v1/messages`, `/gemini/:version/models/:model`, or task interfaces; no additional parameters needed to enjoy automatic retry and switching.  
- Before scaling: Validate with small traffic first; batch or long streaming scenarios can submit in batches to reduce instantaneous concurrency.  

## Request Example (Streaming Chat)
<CodeGroup>
```ts TypeScript
await fetch("https://app.memorylake.ai/v1/chat/completions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer sk-demo123",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Please give me an opening script for a product launch event" }],
    stream: true
  })
});
```
```py Python
import requests

resp = requests.post(
    "https://app.memorylake.ai/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer sk-demo123",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    json={
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Please give me an opening script for a product launch event"}],
        "stream": True,
    },
)
```
```bash cURL
curl https://app.memorylake.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-demo123" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Please give me an opening script for a product launch event"}],
    "stream": true
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage Reminders
- Automatic retry and channel switching depend on enabled and healthy backup channels; switching is unavailable if not enabled.
- When rate limiting guardrails take effect, speed may be reduced; recommend batching or staggering calls.
- On streaming exceptions, the platform will close connections; you can supplement retry logic on the client side as needed.
