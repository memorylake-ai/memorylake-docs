description: "Pre-deduction and settlement two-phase, independent quotas and pricing metadata, ensuring controllable usage and transparent billing"
---

## Core Capabilities
- Pre-deduction and Settlement Two-Phase: Pre-allocate quota before requests, settle based on real usage after completion, reducing overruns or missed billing.
- Independent Quotas: Quotas for different tokens or token groups are managed independently without interference.
- Pricing Metadata: Model directory returns pricing and owned_by information for frontend display and cost estimation.

## Use Cases
- Want to confirm whether quota is sufficient before calling to avoid mid-request failures.
- Multi-team, multi-application, or multi-token groups need independent quotas and model visibility ranges.
- Frontend or configuration centers need to pull pricing metadata to display source and cost information.

## Deduction Process
1) Before request: Platform checks available quota by token/context; insufficient quota directly rejects the request.  
2) After request completion: Settle based on real usage without overcharging; failed requests do not consume additional quota.  
3) View pricing: View model pricing information on the [Available Models List page](https://app.memorylake.ai/panel/available_model).

## How to View Quotas and Billing Details
- Total quota and usage: In the quota card in the console sidebar and team quota page, view available quota and consumed quota for the current context (see "Team Collaboration / Quotas and Usage" for details).  
- Single call billing: On the [Logs](https://app.memorylake.ai/panel/log) page, click any call to open the details popup, where you can see input/output pricing, conversion process, actual deducted quota, and quota source (personal/team/mixed) for this call.

## Key Return Fields (Model Directory)
- `id`: Model identifier, used for the `model` field in subsequent requests.
- `owned_by`: Model source or ownership.
- Pricing metadata: Used for frontend display and cost estimation; actual billing is based on settlement results.

## Usage Reminders
- Available quota and model ranges are based on actual token or token group configuration; unenabled models are not visible or available.
- Pricing and owned_by come from model directory returns; billing is still based on settlement phase results.
