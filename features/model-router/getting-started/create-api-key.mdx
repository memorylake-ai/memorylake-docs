## What is an API Key?

An API Key is your authentication credential for accessing Model Router. It's like a password that allows you to make requests to the API. Each API key is associated with a specific group that controls which models you can access and how much quota you have.

## How to Create an API Key

### Step 1: Navigate to API Key Management

1. Log in to the [Memorylake Console](https://app.memorylake.ai)
2. Click on "API Keys" or navigate to the [API Keys management page](https://app.memorylake.ai/panel/token)

### Step 2: Create a New API Key

1. Click the "Create API Key" button
2. Enter a name for your API key (this is just for your reference)
3. Configure the settings:
   - **Name**: Choose any name you like (e.g., "My Project API Key")
   - **Quota**: Set to unlimited if you want no restrictions, or set a specific limit
   - **Group**: Select the API key group (this determines which models are available)

<Info>
The API key name is only for your reference and can be changed later. The quota setting controls how much you can use before needing to recharge.

### Step 3: Save Your API Key

After creating the API key, you'll see a key that starts with `sk-`. **Important**: Copy and save this key immediately, as you won't be able to see it again after closing the dialog.

<Warning>
Make sure to save your API key in a secure place. If you lose it, you'll need to create a new one. Never share your API key publicly or commit it to version control.
</Warning>
