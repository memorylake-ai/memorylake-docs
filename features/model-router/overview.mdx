## Quick Introduction

Model Router provides a unified model routing and multimodal task entry point, compatible with mainstream protocols and channels.

- One entry point covers mainstream models and tasks, compatible with OpenAI-style calls without changing SDKs
- Preserves native paths for Claude, Gemini, and others to reduce migration and switching costs
- Built-in stability, quota settlement, notifications, and security policies to help you confidently integrate in production
