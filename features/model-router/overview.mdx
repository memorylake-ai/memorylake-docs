## Quick Introduction

Model Router provides a unified model routing and multimodal task entry point, compatible with mainstream protocols and channels.

- One entry point covers mainstream models and tasks, compatible with OpenAI-style calls without changing SDKs
- Preserves native paths for Claude, Gemini, and others to reduce migration and switching costs
- Built-in stability, quota settlement, notifications, and security policies to help you confidently integrate in production

## Quick Start

1) Get a token: Generate a token in the [console](https://app.memorylake.ai/panel/token), ensuring the associated group has enabled the required models and quotas.  
2) View available models: Call `/v1/models` or the corresponding native path to confirm models and channels available to the current token.  
3) Choose an entry point: Use OpenAI-style SDKs by directly changing the base URL, or use Claude or Gemini native paths.  
4) Send requests: Pass parameters according to the model or task interface requirements, replace `Authorization` and the target model to get started.
