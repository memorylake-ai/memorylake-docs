## What is Usage and Billing?

Every time you make an API call, it consumes quota and generates a billing record. This guide shows you how to view your usage statistics and understand how you're being charged.

<Info>
Quota is checked before each request. If you don't have enough quota, the request will be rejected. See [Limits and Prerequisites](/features/model-router/others/limits-and-prerequisites) for more details.
</Info>

## How Quota Works

Model Router uses a two-phase quota system:

1. **Pre-deduction**: Before your request is processed, the system checks if you have enough quota
2. **Settlement**: After the request completes, you're charged based on actual usage

  />
</Frame>

<Info>
Failed requests don't consume additional quota beyond the initial pre-deduction check. You're only charged for successful requests based on actual usage.
</Info>

## Viewing Your Total Quota and Usage

### In the Console Sidebar

1. Log in to the [Memorylake Console](https://app.memorylake.ai/panel)
2. Look at the quota card in the sidebar
3. You'll see:
   - **Available quota**: How much you have left
   - **Used quota**: How much you've consumed
   - **Context**: Whether you're using personal or team quota

### On the Team Quota Page

1. Navigate to the team quota page in the console
2. View detailed quota information for your team
3. See breakdown by different quota sources (personal/team/mixed)

<Info>
For more details about team quotas and collaboration, see the [Team Collaboration documentation](/features/team-collaboration/quota-and-usage).
</Info>

## Viewing Individual Call Billing

### Step 1: Open the Logs Page

1. Go to the [Logs page](https://app.memorylake.ai/panel/log) in the console
2. You'll see a list of all your API calls

### Step 2: View Call Details

1. Click on any call in the list
2. A details popup will open showing:
   - **Input/Output pricing**: Cost per token
   - **Conversion process**: How the billing was calculated
   - **Actual deducted quota**: How much quota was used
   - **Quota source**: Whether it came from personal, team, or mixed quota

    style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
  />

## Understanding Billing Details

### Pricing Information

- **Input tokens**: The cost for tokens you send to the model
- **Output tokens**: The cost for tokens the model generates
- **Total cost**: The sum of input and output costs

### Quota Sources

Your quota can come from:
- **Personal quota**: Your individual quota
- **Team quota**: Shared team quota
- **Mixed**: Combination of personal and team quota

### Settlement

- Billing is based on **actual usage**, not estimates
- Failed requests don't consume additional quota
- You're only charged for what you actually use

## Model Pricing

You can also view model pricing information on the [Available Models List page](https://app.memorylake.ai/panel/available_model) in the console. This shows pricing metadata for reference, but actual billing is based on settlement results.

<Info>
Pricing shown in the model list is for reference only. Your actual charges are calculated based on real usage during the settlement phase.
</Info>

## Important Notes

1. **Quota Limits**: If you run out of quota, requests will be rejected. Make sure you have enough quota before making calls.

2. **Independent Quotas**: Different API keys and groups have independent quotas. Using one API key doesn't affect another.

3. **Real-time Updates**: Usage statistics update in real-time. You can monitor your usage as you make calls.

4. **Billing Accuracy**: You're only charged for successful requests based on actual token usage.

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient Quota" Error

If you get this error:
1. Check your quota in the console sidebar
2. Make sure you have enough quota for the model you're using
3. Contact your administrator if you need more quota

### Unexpected Charges

If you see unexpected charges:
1. Check the call details in the logs
2. Review the input/output token counts
3. Verify the model pricing matches your expectations
