title: "Multimodal and Task Interfaces"
description: "Complete drawing, music, video, and other task submissions and result queries through a unified entry point"

## Core Capabilities
- Midjourney: Supports imagine, describe, blend, change, shorten, notify, and other capabilities, including task queries and image retrieval, with support for image uploads and face replacement.  
- Suno: Submit music or voice-over generation tasks and poll for task progress and results.  
- RecraftAI: Supports vectorization, background removal, clarity enhancement, style management, and other image tasks.  
- Kling: Supports text-to-video and image-to-video tasks, including task submission and status queries.  

## Use Cases
- Want to integrate drawing, music, video, and other multimodal capabilities under one platform.  
- Need to submit requests in a "task" manner and query progress and results later via task ID, rather than returning everything at once.  
- Need to see usage and billing details for multimodal tasks uniformly in call logs and quota views.  

## Basic Task Call Flow
1) Submit task: Submit a request through the corresponding task interface (e.g., Midjourney imagine, Suno jobs), returning a task ID.  
2) Poll query: Call the query interface based on the task ID to check current status (queued, running, completed, failed, etc.).  
3) Get results: After task completion, retrieve images, audio, video, or related links from query results, and view billing details for this task in logs.

## Midjourney: Drawing Tasks

### Submit Imagine Task
<CodeGroup>
```ts TypeScript
await fetch("https://app.memorylake.ai/midjourney/imagine", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer sk-demo123",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    prompt: "a cyberpunk city at night, neon lights, 4k",
    notify: true
  })
});
```
```py Python
import requests

resp = requests.post(
    "https://app.memorylake.ai/midjourney/imagine",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer sk-demo123",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    json={
        "prompt": "a cyberpunk city at night, neon lights, 4k",
        "notify": True,
    },
)
```
```bash cURL
curl https://app.memorylake.ai/midjourney/imagine \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-demo123" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "a cyberpunk city at night, neon lights, 4k",
    "notify": true
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

### Query Task and Get Images
The interface returns a task ID. You can poll by task ID and retrieve image links or file addresses.

  />

## Suno: Music and Voice-Over Tasks

### Submit Music Generation Task
<CodeGroup>
```ts TypeScript
await fetch("https://app.memorylake.ai/suno/jobs", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer sk-demo123",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    prompt: "soft lo-fi background music for coding",
    mode: "music"
  })
});
```
```py Python
import requests

resp = requests.post(
    "https://app.memorylake.ai/suno/jobs",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer sk-demo123",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    json={
        "prompt": "soft lo-fi background music for coding",
        "mode": "music",
    },
)
```
```bash cURL
curl https://app.memorylake.ai/suno/jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-demo123" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "soft lo-fi background music for coding",
    "mode": "music"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

After successful submission, you can query progress and audio results (such as playback links, download links, etc.) by task ID.

## RecraftAI: Image Processing Tasks
- Vectorization: Convert bitmaps to vector graphics.  
- Background Removal: Remove image backgrounds, keeping only foreground subjects.  
- Clarity Enhancement: Enlarge images without significant quality loss.  
- Style Management: Apply specific styles to images or switch between existing styles.  

You can use these capabilities by following the pattern "submit task → poll query → get processed image link", with calling methods consistent with the task interfaces above.

## Kling: Video Generation Tasks
- Text-to-Video: Provide text prompts to generate videos.  
- Image-to-Video: Upload images and combine with text prompts to generate videos.  

The calling method is the same: submit a task and query by task ID. After completion, you can retrieve video links from results and view usage and billing for this task in log details.

  />

## Relationship with Quotas and Logs
- All multimodal and task interfaces consume quotas for the corresponding token/context, with billing logic consistent with other model calls (see "Quotas and Settlement" for details).  
- Input content, generation results, and billing details for each task are reflected in call logs; you can see the calculation process and quota source for this task in the details popup.  

## Usage Reminders
- Task interfaces are typically completed asynchronously; reserve polling and result retrieval logic rather than assuming immediate return of finished products.  
- Multimodal tasks have relatively larger data volumes; combine team quotas and alert mechanisms to avoid submitting too many large tasks in a short time.
