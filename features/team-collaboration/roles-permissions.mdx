## Role Types
- **Owner**: The creator or transferred responsible person who can delete teams, transfer ownership, allocate quotas, adjust roles, and remove members.  
- **Administrator**: Daily operations assistant who can invite/remove members and adjust quotas and roles, but cannot delete teams or take ownership.  
- **Member**: Normal users who can use team quotas and make calls, view information related to themselves, and voluntarily exit the team.

## Available Operations
- Team Management: Create, update information, close, or delete. Only owners can transfer ownership.  
- Members and Invitations: Email or link invitations; can resend or revoke; invitees accept after logging in; members can voluntarily exit.  
- Quota Allocation: Allocate or adjust quotas for teams or individual members; insufficient quotas will directly intercept calls.  
- Role Adjustment: Elevate or restrict member permissions to ensure sensitive operations are only in the hands of authorized personnel.  
- Statistics Viewing: Team statistics and member rankings; members can view their own usage.  
- Identity Switching: Switch to the correct personal/team context before making calls. Permissions and quotas take effect according to the current context.  

## Setting Up a New Team (From Scratch)
1) Create a team and complete information in [Teams > My Teams](https://app.memorylake.ai/panel/team).  
2) Set core colleagues as administrators and others as members.  
3) Go to "Invitations" to send emails or generate links. Mistakenly sent invitations can be revoked, and unaccepted ones can be resent.  
4) Allocate quotas to members in the "Members" page, then switch calls to the team context.  

## Secure Handover (Changing Responsibility)
1) In the "Members" page, confirm that the successor is already in the team and has an appropriate role.  
2) The owner executes "Transfer Ownership". After completion, the original owner is automatically downgraded.  
3) If you need to tighten permissions, adjust administrator/member roles or quotas.  

## Tips
- Check the current context before each call to avoid consuming personal quotas in the team context or vice versa.  
- High-risk operations such as deleting teams, transferring ownership, adjusting others' quotas, and removing members are limited to authorized roles.  
- Quota/status validation takes effect in real time: tokens with insufficient quotas, disabled status, or expired status will be rejected.  
- Statistics are based on actual call accumulation. Empty statistics initially are normal; they will reflect real consumption after sustained usage.  

## Next Steps
- For more detailed invitation and access strategies, quotas and usage, analytics and lifecycle, refer to the corresponding sections.  
- Before migrating to production, use test tokens to verify that roles, quotas, and context switching meet expectations.
