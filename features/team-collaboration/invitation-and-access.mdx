## Use Cases
- Quickly invite colleagues to share team quotas and API calls.
- Resend or revoke invitations in a controlled manner to avoid mistakes or expiration.
- Invitees need to accept after logging in, or register directly through the invitation.

## How to Invite
- **Email Invitation**: Enter an email address to send an invitation. Supports resending and revocation, and remains controllable before acceptance.
- **Invitation Link**: Generate a link with one click. After sharing, invitees can accept after logging in. If sent by mistake, the link can be revoked and invalidated.
- **Invitee Experience**: Supports accepting invitations after logging in, or completing registration through the invitation. After joining, members enter the team according to their assigned role.

## Joining and Access Control
- **Pre-acceptance Control**: Unaccepted invitations can be revoked at any time. If the email is incorrect, revoke and resend directly.
- **Post-acceptance Control**: After members join, you can adjust their roles and quotas, or remove members if necessary. Members can also voluntarily exit.
- **Context and Permissions**: After joining the team, API calls will take effect according to the team context and role permissions.

## Quick Start
1) In the "Invitations" page of team details, choose email or link to send an invitation.  
2) If you need to correct or remind, revoke or resend unaccepted invitations.  
3) Invitees accept the invitation after logging in. If registering through the invitation, they join the team upon completing registration.  
4) After joining, adjust roles and quotas in the "Members" page, then start switching calls to the team context.  

## Tips
- Once an invitation is revoked, it becomes invalid. If you need to continue, resend or generate a new link.
- For sensitive teams, prioritize email invitations and verify email addresses. Links should be revoked after short-term use.
- Confirm the current context before making calls to avoid consuming personal quotas in the team context or vice versa.  

## Next Steps
- Continue configuring roles and permissions, quotas and usage, analytics and lifecycle to ensure team collaboration and usage are controlled.
