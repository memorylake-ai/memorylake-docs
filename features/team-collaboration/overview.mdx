## Quick Introduction

Team collaboration features help you manage shared API endpoints, quotas, and logs for multi-user collaboration while maintaining clear access control.

- Share API endpoints, quotas, and logs with colleagues while maintaining clear access control
- Invite members instantly via link or email, with the ability to revoke or resend invitations
- Assign individual quotas to members and view team-wide usage and rankings
- Switch between personal and team contexts to ensure calls follow the current context

## Quick Start

1) [Create a team](https://app.memorylake.ai/panel/team): Add a name and description, and confirm default role assignment rules.

    style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}

2) Invite colleagues: Choose link or email invitation based on your scenario. Resend if not received, or revoke if sent by mistake.

3) Quotas and roles: Assign owner or administrator roles to key members, and allocate quotas to members.
